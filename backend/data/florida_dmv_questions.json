    "question": "To check your blind spot when changing lanes to the left, you should glance:",
    "options": [
      "Over your right shoulder",
      "At your side mirror",
      "Over your left shoulder",
      "At your rearview mirror"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Over your left shoulder",
    "explanation": "When changing lanes to the left, you should always check your blind spot by glancing over your left shoulder. While mirrors are helpful, they don't show the entire area around your vehicle. The blind spot is an area that cannot be seen in your mirrors, and the only way to check it properly is by physically turning your head to look. This quick check helps ensure there are no vehicles in the space you're about to move into, preventing potential collisions."

      "Honk at the officer",
      "Check to see what the cars next to them are doing"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Follow the directions given by the officer",
    "explanation": "When a police officer is directing traffic, you must follow their directions even if they conflict with existing traffic signals, signs, or laws. An officer's hand signals and directions take precedence over traffic lights or signs."

      "The effect that anger has",
      "The effect that driving with teenagers has"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "The effect that alcohol has",
    "explanation": "Driving while drowsy or fatigued can impair your driving ability similarly to alcohol. Studies show that being awake for 18 hours produces impairment equal to a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.05%, and being awake for 24 hours is comparable to a BAC of 0.10%, which is above the legal limit in all states."

  "5": {
    "question": "A person who drives much slower than the speed limit:",
    "options": [
      "Is a very safe driver",

      "May create a dangerous driving environment"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "May create a dangerous driving environment",
    "explanation": "Driving significantly below the speed limit can be as dangerous as speeding. It can disrupt the normal flow of traffic, cause congestion, and lead to aggressive driving behaviors from other motorists. In Florida, driving too slowly can be considered a moving violation if it impedes the normal flow of traffic."

      "Lanes are moving in the same direction and drivers are permitted to pass when it is safe to do so"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Lanes are moving in opposite directions and drivers are not permitted to pass",
    "explanation": "A solid white line down the center of a two-lane road indicates that the lanes are moving in opposite directions and passing is prohibited. This marking is used in areas where passing would be dangerous, such as curves, hills, or intersections."

      "Hazard lights while moving"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Low beam headlights",
    "explanation": "When driving in fog, you should use your low beam headlights. High beams reflect off the fog and create glare, making it harder to see. Low beams direct the light down toward the road, improving visibility in foggy conditions."

      "0.00%"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "0.02%",
    "explanation": "In Florida, drivers under 21 years of age are subject to a 'Zero Tolerance' law, which sets the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit at 0.02%. This is stricter than the 0.08% limit for drivers 21 and older, reflecting the state's commitment to preventing underage drinking and driving."

    "correct_answer": "Stop completely and only proceed when the signals stop flashing",
    "explanation": "When approaching a railroad crossing with flashing signals, you must stop at least 15 feet from the nearest rail and not proceed until the signals stop flashing. Flashing signals indicate that a train is approaching, and it's illegal and extremely dangerous to ignore these warnings."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "Come to a complete stop first and yield to all other traffic",
    "explanation": "When making a right turn on a red light in Florida, you must first come to a complete stop, check for traffic and pedestrians, and yield the right-of-way to all other traffic before proceeding with your turn. Right turns on red are permitted unless a posted sign prohibits it."

      "The traffic light is out of order"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Slow down and proceed with caution",
    "explanation": "A flashing yellow traffic light means you should slow down and proceed with caution. Unlike a flashing red light, which requires a complete stop, a flashing yellow indicates a warning to be alert and cautious while proceeding through the intersection."

      "Continue driving in your lane at the same speed",
      "Change lanes and slow down"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Pull over to the right edge of the road and stop",
    "explanation": "When an emergency vehicle with flashing lights is approaching, you must pull over to the right edge of the road and stop until the emergency vehicle has passed. This is required by Florida law and helps ensure that emergency vehicles can respond quickly to urgent situations."
  },
  "15": {
    "question": "What does a solid yellow line in the center of the road mean?",

      "The road is a one-way street"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Passing is not permitted",

      "Reduce your speed",
      "Turn on your hazard lights"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Reduce your speed",
    "explanation": "To avoid hydroplaning in heavy rain, you should reduce your speed. Hydroplaning occurs when your tires lose contact with the road surface due to water buildup. Slowing down allows your tires to maintain better contact with the road and reduces the risk of losing control of your vehicle."
  },
  "18": {
    "question": "What should you do if your vehicle starts to skid?",
    "options": [
      "Brake hard and turn the wheel in the opposite direction of the skid",

      "Parallel to the curb",
      "It doesn't matter"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Away from the curb",
    "explanation": "When parking uphill with a curb, you should turn your front wheels away from the curb (toward the street). This way, if your brakes fail, your vehicle will roll back against the curb, preventing it from rolling into traffic."
  },

      "5-6 seconds behind the vehicle ahead"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "3-4 seconds behind the vehicle ahead",
    "explanation": "In normal driving conditions, you should maintain a following distance of 3-4 seconds behind the vehicle ahead. This provides enough time to react and stop safely if the vehicle in front of you stops suddenly. In adverse conditions like rain or fog, you should increase this distance."
  },
  "23": {
    "question": "What does a yellow traffic signal light mean?",
    "options": [
      "Speed up to clear the intersection",
      "The light will soon turn red, so prepare to stop",

      "The intersection is clear in all directions"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "The light will soon turn red, so prepare to stop",
    "explanation": "A yellow traffic signal light warns that the light will soon turn red. You should prepare to stop safely. If you're too close to the intersection to stop safely when the light turns yellow, proceed through cautiously."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "To reduce traffic congestion by encouraging carpooling",
    "explanation": "HOV (High Occupancy Vehicle) lanes are designed to reduce traffic congestion by encouraging carpooling. These lanes are reserved for vehicles with a minimum number of occupants (usually two or more), which helps decrease the total number of vehicles on the road during peak travel times."

      "Stop and ask another driver for directions"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Continue to the next exit",
    "explanation": "If you miss your exit on a highway, you should continue to the next exit. Never stop, back up, or try to turn around on a highway, as these actions are extremely dangerous and illegal. Proceed to the next exit, then re-enter the highway in the opposite direction if necessary."

    "correct_answer": "When preparing for a left turn or when passing",
    "explanation": "In Florida, it is legal to drive in the left lane of a multi-lane highway when you are preparing for a left turn or when passing another vehicle. Florida law requires drivers to drive in the right lane except when overtaking and passing another vehicle, when preparing for a left turn, or when the right lane is closed to traffic."
